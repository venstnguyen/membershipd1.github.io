        <h2><u>Overiew of the Membership Information</u></h2>
        <p> <dd> Residents inside and outside of Golden have the opportunity to join a community of those 
          who want to help support the environment by reducing food waste. While our country continues 
          to rely on the convenience of landfills, landfills continue to become filled with food packaging 
          waste. However, businesses in Golden have come together to help rectify this problem and want to 
          work with the citizens inside and outside of Golden. Everyone can help reduce the amount of food 
          packaging that ends up in landfills by joining this membership program.</dd>
        </p>
        <p2>

        <h2> <u>Why buying the box is worth it</u></h2>
        <p2><dd>This box not only gets you access to this membership, but our boxes keep baked goods fresher. 
          A test was run with five participants, testing the freshness of doughnuts sitting in standard 
          packaging and the skeleton box for 12 hours. The participants consisted of five Colorado School of Mines
          students, with ages ranging from 18 to 20. The participants were each given two doughnuts, and
          without knowing which doughnuts came from which box, each tasted their doughnuts. The participants
          were then asked to rank the freshness of the donut on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being not fresh and
          3 being optimal freshness. Through these tests it was discovered that a majority of the participants ranked the
          skeleton box higher than standard packaging.</dd> </p2>
